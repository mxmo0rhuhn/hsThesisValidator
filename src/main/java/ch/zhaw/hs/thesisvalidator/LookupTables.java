	/**
	 * This function generates elements of lookup tables. It is assumed that we have two dimensional lookup tables with
	 * x and y axis each ranging from 0 to n (exclusive). For n, this means there are n^n^n possible permutations. <br />
	 * Example table (n = 3, perm = 1)
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 *        x
	 *      0 1 2
	 *     ------
	 *   0| 0 0 0
	 * y 1| 0 0 0
	 *   2| 0 0 1
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * If this was the first permutation, all values would be zeros. The idea of the algorithm is to look at these
	 * tables as a sequence of numbers. The above example would therefore translate to the following sequence:
	 * '0000001'. If we now look at all possible permutations of zeros, ones and twos of this sequence, it should be
	 * obvious that these are nothing else but the ternary representation of all numbers ranging from 0 to n^n^n.

	 * @param x
	 *            index of x axis
	 * @param y

	 * @param perm
	 *            permutation number
	 * @param n
	 *            number of elements in each table. must be less than 11.
	 * @return the element at the specified x and y position of the perm-th permutation.
